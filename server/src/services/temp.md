These are the values we want to add together.  It's crucial to include parameters within the parentheses of the function definition.\n\n\n\n* **`{`:** This opens the function's code block.\n\n\n\n* **`return a + b;`:** This is the core of the function.  It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and then uses the `return` keyword to send that sum back as the result of calling the `sum` function.\n\n\n\n* **`}`:** This closes the function's code block.\n\n\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n\n\n``` \n\njavascript\n\nlet result = sum(5, 3);  // Calling the function with arguments 5 and 3\n\nconsole.log(result);       // Output: 8\n\n\n\nlet anotherResult = sum(10, -2); // Calling the function with arguments 10 and -2\n\nconsole.log(anotherResult);      // Output: 8\n\n``` \n\n\n\n\n\n**Key Improvements over the Original:**\n\n\n\nThe original code `function sum(){ return a+b; }`  has a significant problem: it refers to `a` and `b` without defining them as parameters to the function.  This means the function would only work if `a` and `b` were defined in a scope *outside* the function (e.g., as global variables).  That's bad practice and makes the function less reusable and predictable.\n\n\n\nThe corrected version explicitly defines `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function self-contained and much more reliable.  It's the standard and correct way to write a sum function in JavaScript.\n\n"
